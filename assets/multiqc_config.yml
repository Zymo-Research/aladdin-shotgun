    parent_name: "Diversity Analysis"
    section_name: "Alpha Diversity"
    description: "Alpha diversity is a measurement of the microbial diversity of each group. For analyses with group comparison, a box-and-whisker plot of observed species in each group is shown."

  Alpha_Rarefaction:
    anchor: "Alpha_Rarefaction"
    parent_id: Diversity_Analysis
    parent_name: "Diversity Analysis"
    section_name: "Alpha Rarefaction"
    description: "This section shows an interactive alpha rarefaction plot, which is the alpha diversity (species richness) as a function of the sampling depth (sequencing read counts). Rarefaction is a technique to correct for uneven sampling when performing diversity analyses. Rarefaction curves can help to identify if sampling depth is sufficient to capture the true diversity of the community. Rarefaction curves are generated by randomly subsampling sequencing reads over a range of values and determining the alpha diversity at each read depth (as an average of 5 iterations). Curves computed by different metrics can be found by clicking on the dropdown menu to the left of the plot"

  beta_diversity:
    anchor: "beta_diversity"
    parent_id: Diversity_Analysis
    parent_name: "Diversity Analysis"
    section_name: "Beta Diversity"
    description: "Beta diversity is a measurement of microbial diversity differences between samples. The figure below is the 3-dimensional principle coordinate analysis (PCoA) plot created using the matrix of paired-wise distance between samples calculated by the Weighted unifrac, Unweighted unifrac, Bray-Curtis, and Jaccard dissimilarity. Interactive 3-dimensional plots of beta-diversity with different matrices can be accessed by clicking the dropdown menus below. Each dot on the beta diversity plot represents the whole microbial composition profile. Samples with similar microbial composition profiles are closer to each other, while samples with different profiles are farther away from each other."
